# Diabetes Detection Dashboard (Power BI)

A Power BI dashboard developed to analyze patient health indicators and identify patterns associated with diabetes occurrence using structured medical and demographic data.

---

## Project Overview
This dashboard examines clinical and lifestyle attributes linked to diabetes and presents them through interactive visualizations. The objective is to uncover trends, correlations, and high-risk segments for analytical understanding and awareness.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze key health indicators related to diabetes  
- Identify demographic and clinical risk patterns  
- Compare diabetic vs non-diabetic patient profiles  
- Present healthcare data in a clear, visual manner  

---

## Key Dashboards & Analysis

### 1. Patient Overview
- Total patients analyzed
- Diabetes outcome (Positive / Negative)
- Distribution by:
  - Age group  
  - Gender  

**Question Answered:**  
Which demographic segments show higher diabetes prevalence?

---

### 2. Clinical Indicators Analysis
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Insulin levels
- Skin thickness

Distribution and comparison across outcome groups.

---

### 3. Risk Factor Analysis
- Diabetes occurrence by:
  - Age  
  - BMI categories  
  - Family history (where available)  
  - Lifestyle indicators  

**Insight Focus:**  
Highlights clinical and lifestyle factors strongly associated with diabetes risk.

---

### 4. Correlation & Pattern Analysis
- Relationship between glucose levels and diabetes outcome
- Combined impact of multiple indicators
- Comparison of average clinical metrics between diabetic and non-diabetic patients

---

## Measures & Calculations
- Diabetes Prevalence Rate  
- Average Glucose Level  
- Average BMI  
- Average Insulin  
- Risk Group Segmentation  

All measures are interactive and respond to slicers.

---

## Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX (measures & calculated columns)  
- Power Query for data cleaning  
- Data modeling  

---

## Key Insights
- Higher glucose levels strongly correlate with diabetes occurrence  
- Elevated BMI is a significant contributing factor  
- Risk increases with age and multiple combined indicators  
- Clear separation exists between diabetic and non-diabetic profiles  

---

## Recommendations
- Monitor high-risk indicators collectively rather than individually  
- Use trend analysis to identify vulnerable segments early  
- Maintain consistent tracking of glucose and BMI metrics  
- Apply data-driven segmentation for risk awareness  

---

## Use Cases
- Healthcare analytics portfolio  
- Medical data visualization practice  
- Risk pattern exploration  
- Academic and interview demonstrations
