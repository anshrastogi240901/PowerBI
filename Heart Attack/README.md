# Heart Attack Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

A Power BI dashboard designed to analyze heart attack–related health indicators and uncover patterns that help understand risk factors, trends, and correlations across patient data.

---

## Project Overview
This dashboard explores medical and lifestyle attributes associated with heart attack occurrences. It provides a structured analytical view of key health metrics, demographic factors, and risk indicators to support data-driven insights and awareness.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze key health indicators linked to heart attacks  
- Identify high-risk demographic and lifestyle segments  
- Explore correlations between clinical parameters  
- Present medical data in an intuitive, visual format  

---

## Key Dashboards & Analysis

### 1. Patient Overview
- Total patients analyzed
- Heart attack occurrence (Yes / No)
- Distribution by:
  - Age group  
  - Gender  

**Question Answered:**  
Which demographic segments show higher heart attack incidence?

---

### 2. Clinical Indicators Analysis
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate
- Blood sugar levels

Trend and distribution analysis across patient groups.

---

### 3. Risk Factor Analysis
- Heart attack occurrence by:
  - Smoking status  
  - Physical activity  
  - Diabetes  
  - Family history  

**Insight Focus:**  
Highlights lifestyle and hereditary factors associated with higher risk.

---

### 4. Correlation & Pattern Analysis
- Relationship between age and heart attack occurrence
- Impact of multiple risk factors combined
- Comparison of clinical indicators across outcome groups

---

## Measures & Calculations
- Heart Attack Rate  
- Average Age  
- Average Cholesterol  
- Average Blood Pressure  
- Risk Group Segmentation  

All measures are interactive and respond to slicers.

---

## Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX  
- Power Query for data transformation  
- Data modeling  

---

## Key Insights
- Heart attack incidence increases with age  
- Certain lifestyle factors significantly elevate risk  
- Patients with multiple risk indicators show higher occurrence  
- Clinical parameters differ noticeably between outcome groups  

---

## Recommendations
- Focus preventive efforts on high-risk groups  
- Encourage lifestyle changes for vulnerable segments  
- Use combined risk indicators rather than isolated metrics  
- Track key health parameters consistently  

---

## Use Cases
- Healthcare analytics portfolio  
- Risk factor exploration  
- Data visualization practice with medical datasets  
- Academic and interview demonstrations
