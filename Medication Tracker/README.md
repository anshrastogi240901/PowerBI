# Medication Tracker Dashboard (Power BI)

A data-driven Power BI dashboard designed to monitor medication adherence, schedules, dosage patterns, and missed doses, enabling better health tracking and informed decision-making.

---

## Project Overview
This dashboard helps users track medication intake over time by providing clear visibility into schedules, adherence rates, missed doses, and medication-wise patterns. It is designed to support consistency, reduce missed doses, and improve overall medication management.

---

## Objectives
- Track daily and weekly medication adherence  
- Monitor missed, delayed, and completed doses  
- Analyze medication-wise intake patterns  
- Identify adherence gaps and improvement areas  
- Enable structured, visual medication monitoring  

---

## Key Dashboards & Analysis

### 1. Medication Overview
- Total medications tracked
- Total scheduled doses
- Doses taken vs missed
- Overall adherence rate


---

### 2. Adherence Analysis
- Adherence rate by:
  - Medication name  
  - Day  
  - Week  
- Missed dose frequency
- Trend analysis of adherence over time

**Insight Focus:**  
Identifies medications or time periods with lower adherence.

---

### 3. Schedule & Timing Analysis
- Medication intake by:
  - Time of day  
  - Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night  
- Delayed vs on-time doses
- Peak missed-dose time windows

---

### 4. Medication-wise Insights
- Dosage frequency by medication
- Most frequently missed medications
- Consistency comparison across medications


---

## Measures & Calculations
- Total Scheduled Doses  
- Doses Taken  
- Missed Doses  
- Adherence Percentage  
- On-time vs Delayed Intake  

All measures are dynamic and responsive to filters and slicers.

## Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX (measures & calculated columns)  
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
- Data modeling  

---

## Key Insights
- Adherence drops during specific time windows  
- Certain medications have higher missed-dose frequency  
- Routine-based scheduling improves consistency  
- Visual reminders help identify adherence gaps quickly  

---

## Recommendations
- Introduce reminders for high-risk time slots  
- Simplify schedules for frequently missed medications  
- Monitor adherence trends weekly for corrective action  
- Use adherence rate as a primary tracking metric  

---

## Use Cases
- Personal medication tracking  
- Health monitoring dashboards  
- Analytics portfolio project  
- Demonstration of time-series and behavioral analytics
